  tweets from an users profile page.

## 0.8.1 ( 2018-07-18 )
- saving .csv files as an utf-8 encoded file. This fixes https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/138

## 0.8.0 ( 2018-07-17 )
### Fixed
- remove two headers which caused bad fetching results https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/126#issuecomment-405132147
- fix python2 logger bug https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/134 https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/132 https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/127

### Improved
- Use a generator to get tweets, but convert to list in `query_tweets_once`
  - this is useful for low memory applications, like massively parallelizing twitter scraping through AWS Lambda (128MB RAM)
- use single quotes for all strings (it was inconsistent prior)
- pep8 compliance on L28

### Removed
- remove `eliminate_duplicates` dead code

# 0.7.2 ( 2018-07-09 )
### Fixed
- twitterscraper.logging is imported as logger instead of logging in order to
   avoid a module name clash with Python2's logging module.

# 0.7.1 ( 2018-06-12 )
### Improved
- Give access to logger for scripts which import this module. Create the module,
  `logging.py`, which contains the logger used by twitterscraper.

### Removed
- fake_useragent is removed as a dependency, since it has been giving
user-agent headers which keep being blocked by Twitter.

## 0.7.0 ( 2018-05-06 )
### Fixed
- By using linspace() instead of range() to divide the number of days into
  the number of parallel processes, edge cases ( p = 1 ) now also work fine.
  This fixes https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/108.

### Improved
- The default value of begindate is set to 2006-03-21. The previous value (2017-01-01)
  was chosen arbitrarily and leaded to questions why not all tweets were retrieved.
  This fixes https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/88.

### Added
- Users can now save the tweets in a csv-format, with the arguments "-c" or "--csv"

## 0.6.2 ( 2018-03-21 )
### Fixed
- Errors occuring during the serialization of a non-html response (everything after 1st request),
  No longer crashes the program but is catched with a try / except.
- Fixes https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/93

- The '@' character in an username is now removed by the ".strip('\@')" method instead of "[1:]".
- This fixes issue https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/105

## 0.6.1 ( 2018-03-17 )
### Improved
- The way the number of days are divided over the number of parallel processes is improved.
- The maximum number of parallel processes is limited to the max no of days.
- Fixes https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper/issues/101

## 0.6.0 ( 2018-02-17 )
### Fixed

## 0.4.2 ( 2018-01-09 )
### Fixed
- Fixed backward compatability of the new --lang parameter by placing it at the end of all arguments.

## 0.4.1 ( 2018-01-07 )
### Fixed
- Fixed --lang functionality by passing the lang parameter from its CL argument form to the generater url.

## 0.4 ( 2017-12-19 )
-----------
### Added
- Added "-bd / --begindate" command line arguments to set the begin date of the query
- Added "-ed / --enddate" command line arguments to set the end date of the query.
- Added "-p / --poolsize" command line arguments which can change the number of parallel processes.
  Default number of parallel processes is set to 20.

### Improved
- Outputfile is only created if tweets are actually retrieved.

### Removed
- The ´query_all_tweets' method in the Query module is removed. Since twitterscraper is starting parallel processes by default,
  this method is no longer necessary.

### Changed
- The 'query_tweets' method now takes as arguments query, limit, begindate, enddate, poolsize.
- The 'query_tweets_once' no longer has the argument 'num_tweets'
- The default value of the 'retry' argument of the 'query_single_page' method has been increased from 3 to 10.
- The ´query_tweets_once' method does not log to screen at every single scrape, but at the end of a batch.
